## Installation and running
Git clone the repo and use `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.
Use `node server.js` to start the app.

## How to use
### Authorization
Visit `http://127.0.0.1:3000/microbo/signin` and use `admin4eg` as a username and `microbo` as a password.

### Using JSON editor
JSON tree is a combinations of multiple json files joined together:
- **content.json** - where all app content should be stored.
- **settings.json** - vital parameters to operate Microbo properly.
- **users.json** - array of users that can log to Mircrobo. This file can be served as an example of user authorization.
